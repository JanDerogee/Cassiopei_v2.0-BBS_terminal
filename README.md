# BBS_terminal
This BBS terminal application is specifically for use with the Cassiopei v2.0 (also referred to as the Cassiopei) and Commodore 8-bit computers. The application runs on the Commodore computer and accesses the BBS via the telnet functionality of the Cassiopei.

The intention is to have a version for every 8-bit commodore computer that can work with the Cassiopei.
The first version of the application was written for the C64.
